description: Use when working with Go formatting, line length, nesting, naked returns, semicolons, or core style principles. Also use when a style question isn't covered by a more specific skill, even if the user doesn't reference a specific style rule. Does not cover domain-specific patterns like error handling, naming, or testing (see specialized skills). Acts as fallback when no more specific style skill applies.

# Go Style Core Principles

## Repository Environment

Read the target repository's agent instructions and relevant development skills before running Go tools. Use its prescribed execution environment, module working directory, formatting targets, and checks. Do not assume a particular operating system, VM, repository layout, or Make target.

## Style Reference

Consult the [Uber Go Style Guide](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md) for additional Go style guidance and examples. Follow the target repository's documented rules where they differ from the guide.

## Style Principles (Priority Order)

When writing readable Go code, apply these principles in order of importance:

### Priority Order

1. **Clarity** — Can a reader understand the code without extra context?
2. **Simplicity** — Is this the simplest way to accomplish the goal?
3. **Concision** — Does every line earn its place?
4. **Maintainability** — Will this be easy to modify later?
5. **Consistency** — Does it match surrounding code and project conventions?

> Read [references/PRINCIPLES.md](references/PRINCIPLES.md) when resolving conflicts between clarity, simplicity, and concision, or when you need concrete examples of how each principle applies in real Go code.

## Formatting

Run `gofmt` — no exceptions. There is **no rigid line length limit**, but [Uber suggests a soft limit of 99 characters](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md#avoid-overly-long-lines). Break by semantics, not length — refactor rather than just wrap.

> Read [references/FORMATTING.md](references/FORMATTING.md) when configuring gofmt, deciding on line breaks, applying MixedCaps rules, or resolving local consistency questions.

## Reduce Nesting

Handle error cases and special conditions first. Return early or continue the loop to keep the "happy path" unindented.

```go
// Bad: Deeply nested
for _, v := range data {
    if v.F1 == 1 {
        v = process(v)
        if err := v.Call(); err == nil {
            v.Send()
        } else {
            return err
        }
    } else {
        log.Printf("Invalid v: %v", v)
    }
}

// Good: Flat structure with early returns
for _, v := range data {
    if v.F1 != 1 {
        log.Printf("Invalid v: %v", v)
        continue
    }

    v = process(v)
    if err := v.Call(); err != nil {
        return err
    }
    v.Send()
}
```

### Unnecessary Else

If a variable is set in both branches of an if, use default + override pattern.

```go
// Bad: Setting in both branches
var a int
if b {
    a = 100
} else {
    a = 10
}

// Good: Default + override
a := 10
if b {
    a = 100
}
```

---

## Naked Returns

A `return` statement without arguments returns the named return values. This is
known as a "naked" return.

```go
func split(sum int) (x, y int) {
    x = sum * 4 / 9
    y = sum - x
    return // returns x, y
}
```

### Guidelines for Naked Returns

- **OK in small functions**: Naked returns are fine in functions that are just a
  handful of lines
- **Be explicit in medium+ functions**: Once a function grows to medium size, be
  explicit with return values for clarity
- **Don't name results just for naked returns**: Clarity of documentation is
  always more important than saving a line or two

```go
// Good: Small function, naked return is clear
func minMax(a, b int) (min, max int) {
    if a < b {
        min, max = a, b
    } else {
        min, max = b, a
    }
    return
}

// Good: Larger function, explicit return
func processData(data []byte) (result []byte, err error) {
    result = make([]byte, 0, len(data))

    for _, b := range data {
        if b == 0 {
            return nil, errors.New("null byte in data")
        }
        result = append(result, transform(b))
    }

    return result, nil // explicit: clearer in longer functions
}
```

See [Effective Go: Named result parameters](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#named-results) for guidance on naming return values.

## Semicolons

Go's lexer automatically inserts semicolons after any line whose last token is
an identifier, literal, or one of: `break continue fallthrough return ++ -- ) }`.

This means **opening braces must be on the same line** as the control structure:

```go
// Good: brace on same line
if i < f() {
    g()
}

// Bad: brace on next line — lexer inserts semicolon after f()
if i < f()  // wrong!
{           // wrong!
    g()
}
```

Idiomatic Go only has explicit semicolons in `for` loop clauses and to separate
multiple statements on a single line.

## Quick Reference

| Principle | Key Question |
|-----------|--------------|
| Clarity | Can a reader understand what and why? |
| Simplicity | Is this the simplest approach? |
| Concision | Is the signal-to-noise ratio high? |
| Maintainability | Can this be safely modified later? |
| Consistency | Does this match surrounding code? |
